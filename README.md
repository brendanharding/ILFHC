The Inertial Lift Force Helper Class provides a minimal interface to stripped research data relating to particle migration in curved microfluidic ducts.

Please ensure you cite our Journal of Fluid Mechanics paper (https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.323) if you use this code/data. 
Note that interface makes use of the non-dimensional scaling described within the paper.

Please also don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions/queries.

2023 update:

The folder MDN-python contains data and a helper class associated with the results published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics paper "Inertial focusing of spherical particles in curved microfluidic ducts at moderate Dean numbers" (accepted on 4 Jan 2023).
This data has been pre-processed a little differently than was used in the paper (primarily to facilitate ease of access and efficiency of the helper class).
Consequently results derived from this data may have very minor quantitative differences with that in the paper.
Anyone interested in the original data and how it was processed should get in touch.
This is still in development and will be updated further in the coming days.
